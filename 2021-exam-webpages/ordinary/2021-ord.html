<p><b>Question 3</b></p>
<p>Unicode and the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) are both character 
    sets used for encoding and decoding messages. Identify one advantage of using Unicode rather 
    than ASCII.</p>

<p class="answer">Unicode is a much larger encoding standard. It includes over 149,000 characters.
    It covers most of the world's writing systems, including ASCII, as well as symbols and emojis. ASCII is 
    a character encoding system that only includes up to 256 characters, 
    primarily composed of English letters, numbers, and symbols. It uses up to eight bits to represent each 
    character.</p>

<p><b>Question 4</b></p>
<p>The image in Figure 1 shows drones operating 
inside a modern warehouse full of goods. This is 
one example of how computing technology can 
help automate processes. 
Give another example of how computing 
technology can be used to automate a process 
and explain one benefit provided by your example.</p>

<p class="answer">The toll bridge on the M50 motorway is a good example of how an automated process can be 
    beneficial. It is a much faster system. The traffic doesn't need to stop to pay the toll, so it 
    doesn't cause a traffic jam. And it's also much cheaper because staff don't need to be paid to collect money
    from drivers.
</p>

<p><b>Queston 5</b></p>
<p>The image in Figure 2 depicts a client‐server model over 
    the Internet. Provide one practical example of how a 
    client‐server model is used in our daily interaction with 
    technology.</p>

<img src="/resources/client-server.jpg" width="350px">

<p class="answer">When we use a browser like google to search for a website, the client (the user's computer) 
     sends the request to a server. 
    A server sends the client a list of appropriate search results and then the client can access the website. 
    The resources needed for a website, such as the HTML,
    CSS and javascript files, images, videos and other resources, are stored on a server. When you click the 
    link to access the website, another request is sent to the server, and the website is displayed on the 
    client's computer.
</p>

<p><b>Question 6</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> Answer the following question by putting a tick in the relevant box.<br> 
    Tick one box only.</p>

<p>What is HTTP?</p>

<form>
    <label>the language used to program web pages</label><input type="checkbox"><br>
    <label>the method for encoding data securely</label><input type="checkbox"><br>
    <label>the web browser</label><input type="checkbox"><br>
    <label>the protocol for transferring hypertext for webpages</label><input type="checkbox"><br>  
</form>

<p><b>(b)</b> Describe one difference between the World Wide Web (WWW) and the Internet.</p>
<p class="answer">The world wide web are the media content such as webpages, images, videos and so on, that 
    are stored and made available by the internet. The internet is the infrastructure that connects the networks 
    of connected computers, and which includes routers, gateways, servers and client computers. 
</p>

<p><b>Question 7</b></p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<img src="resources/analogue-digital.jpg" width="500px">

<p>Figure 3 shows the wave signals for analogue and digital inputs. Describe one difference between 
    the two types of input.</p>

<p class="answer">The digital signals represents two values, 1 and 0. This is the principle which utilises Boolean
    operators, an important aspect of computer programming.<br>
    The analogue signal can represent a much larger range of values. Rather than binary values, it is often used to
    measure real time data, such as temperature and light.

<p><b>Question 10</b></p>
<p>The linear search algorithm shown below is to be applied to the following data set:<br>
    L = [10, 25, 21, 15, 85, 69, 74, 22, 19, 6]</p>

<pre class="code-block">
<code>
Linear Search (List L, Value x)
Step 1: Set i to 0
Step 2: Set n to number of items in L
Step 3: if i >= n then go to Step 8
Step 4: if L[i] = x then go to Step 7
Step 5: Set i to i + 1
Step 6: Go to Step 3
Step 7: Print position i and go to Step 9
Step 8: Print “item not found”
Step 9: Exit

<p class="answer">2</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> x = 3</p>
<p class="answer">item not found</p>

<p><b>Question 11</b></p>
<p>Describe one example of how adaptive or assistive technology might be helpful for an elderly 
    person living alone.</p>

<p>A stair lift is assistive technology that can be very useful for elderly people. As people get older, 
    they can find it physically demanding to use the stairs. So rather than not going up stairs anymore, a stair 
    lift can be used. 
</p>

<p><b>Question 12</b></p>
<p>A programmer has written a program to store the name, email address and password of a user of 
    an online chat forum. The programmer has decided to check that the user enters an email address 
    in the correct format.</p>

<p>Describe two checks that could be used to validate the email address.</p>

<p class="answer">
    1. The program could check to see if the email address contains an @ sign.<br>
    2. The program should check the address ends with a domain extension, such as .com or .ie. So the check 
    could look for a dot followed by two or three letters. That will cover all domain extensions.

<p>Answer any one question.</p>

<p><b>Question 13</b></p>

<p>The following article appeared online on July 7th 2020.</p>

<p><b>Contact tracing: Ireland launches its app following 
    Apple and Google's model</b><br>
    Ireland is the latest European country to successfully 
    launch a national contact‐tracing app designed to 
    support the manual program of tracking down and 
    warning people who have been in contact with 
    someone who has tested positive for COVID‐19.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b></p>
<p><b>(i)</b> Assuming that the COVID Tracker app was developed using an iterative design cycle, 
    similar to that in Figure 4, describe two activities that may have been undertaken in 
    the evaluate stage.</p>

<p>Figure 4</p>
<img src="/resources/software-design.jpg" width="500px">

<p class="answer">
    Testing software is an essential step in the evaluation stage. It would have been implemented to ensure the Covid Tracker app 
    did what it was supposed to do and it did this consistently. 
    Testing the contract-tracing app would include functional testing, system testing and acceptance testing. 
    Each type of test requires test data.<br>
    Activity 1: Functional testing involves testing all the functions of the software. Functional testing would have been used to 
    evaluate the usability, accessibility, error conditions and security of the app.<br> 
    Activity 2: System testing would have been used to test the entire system and make sure that the specification of the app 
    satisfied the Irish government's requirements.
</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> The Irish COVID Tracker app was developed by an Irish company called NearForm. Name 
    and describe two possible roles of people involved in the development of the app. </p>

<p class="answer">
    Role 1: Project Manager<br>
    Description: The project manager forms and supervises the team. They monitor progress and ensures the project stays on track; and 
    stay in contact and report to the client. The manager ensures the team implements all stages of the software development process.
</p>

<p class="answer">
    Role 2: Software developer<br>
    Description: The developer writes the code. They make backup copies of the program and carry out unit testing. They also produce 
    the necessary documentation.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> The Irish COVID Tracker app uses technology from Apple and Google that was designed to 
    protect the privacy of the app users.<br> 
    Describe two reasons why the issue of privacy is so important in the development of such a 
    mobile phone contact tracing app.</p>

<p class="answer">
    The app tracks the user's movements and detects if someone has been in contact with someone who has contracted Covid. This involves
    the collecting of personal data such as the user's personal details and their geo-location.<br> 
    1. An Irish citizen's privacy is protected by data protection laws. The data collected by the app needs to meet minimum cyber-security
     standards in order to satisfy GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).<br>
    2. The safe handling of data in accordance with cyber security recommendations prevents that data from being stolen by hackers and 
    used for malicious purposes. The increase in cyber-crime, makes the issue of privacy a very important issue in modern Irish society.
</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> The screenshots in Figure 5 below, show the interface of the Irish COVID Tracker app.</p>
<img src="/resources/covidtracker1.jpg" width="250px"><img src="/resources/covidtracker2.jpg" width="250px">

<p>Explain two principles of universal design that might have been considered when designing 
    this app.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Universal design is the process of designing a product so that everyone can understand, access and use it, regardless of their 
    age, size or ability. Universal design has seven principles, including 'equitable use' and 'simple and intuitive use.'<br>
    1. Equitable use: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.<br>
    2. Simple and intuitive use: The design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge or language skills.
</p>

<p><b>Question 14</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a particular item from a list of items. </p>
<p><b>(i)</b> The binary search algorithm is often called a “divide and conquer” algorithm. Explain why.</p>

<p class="answer">Divide-andconquer is problem solving technique which works by repeatedly reducing the problem
    (divide) and then attempting to solve the problem (conquer) on the new problem space. In
    this case the approach is to repeatedly divide the portion of the list that could contain the
    item in two (i.e. half), until either the item is found or the list cannot be divided any further.</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> Why is the binary search algorithm considered to be more efficient than the linear 
    search algorithm?</p>

<p class="answer"> Every time 'binary search' makes a comparison and fails to find the desired item, it eliminates half of the remaining
    portion of the array that must be searched. With 1,000 elements this takes no more than 10 comparisons. Compare this to the
    performance of the linear search which for this scenario would need to make an average
    number of 500, and a worst case of 1,000 comparisons to achieve the same result.</p>

<p><b>(iii)</b> 
    The following list of numbers is to be searched for a specific number using the binary 
    search algorithm.<br> 
    L = [45, 22, 1, 56, 35, 165, 9, 18, 37, 21, 107, 11, 87]<br>
    Will the binary search algorithm work on this list? Explain your answer. 
</p>

<p class="answer">This list needs to be sorted before it can be searched using binary search.</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> The following list of numbers is to be searched using the binary search algorithm.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>11</td>
        <td>12</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><b>(i)</b> Illustrate the steps taken to find the number 8.</p>

<p class="answer">
    The search algorithm locates the middle element in the list. Seeing as there are an even number of elements, 
    it's rounded down to 6. The program checks if the number 6 is equal to the target number: 8. It's not 8. It's less than 8. So the 
    bottom half of the list is discarded. The list is now 7-12. The program locates the middle value: 9. It's compared to 8. It's not 
    the target value. 9 is greater than than 8 so the list above 9 is discarded. The list is now [7, 8]. The middle value is 7 
    because it's rounded down, it's not equal to 8. It's discarded and 8 is the remaining number.
</p>
 
<p><b>(ii)</b> A list contains 60 numbers in numerical order. Calculate the maximum number of steps 
    that may be required to find a particular number when using a binary search. </p>

<p class="answer">
    n = size of input = 60<br>
    c = max number of comparisons<br>
    <br>
    c = log-base2(n) + 1<br>
    <br>
    c = 7
</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> In America algorithms are being used increasingly to decide whether or not a prisoner 
    should be allowed out of prison while awaiting trial.<br> 
    Describe one potential advantage and one potential disadvantage of using an algorithm for a 
    decision such as this.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Advantage: Algorithms are often based on expert knowledge. This can give a large number of people the ability
    to make expert decisions using software, regardless of their expertise. So, the American legal system could 
    really benefit from making technological tools available to staff to assist with managing prisoners.<br>
    Disadvantage: A prisoner is innocent until proven guilty. Personal information on the prisoner, as well as 
    the crime they are being accused of, would be necessary to make such a decision. Data breaches could result 
    in a potentially innocent person being persecuted if that data was made available to the public.

<p><b>Question 15</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> Your friend complains to you that their five‐year‐old computer is slow for playing games.  
    You check the specifications of the computer and find the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intel Core i3 CPU</li> 
        <li>2GB RAM Memory</li>
        <li>1TB 5400RPM SATA Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</li>

        <li>4‐Cell Li‐ion Battery</li>
    </ul>

<p>Choose two items from this list that are most likely to be having an impact on the speed of 
    the computer and explain their impact.</p>

<p class="answer">
    1. 1TB 5400RPM SATA Hard Disk Drive (HDD)<br>
    Explanation: A hard disk drive is not a good choice in terms of speed. A computer with a solid state drive is 
    much better for playing games. Hard disk drives are cheaper, which is why they are a popular choice. But 
    they have moving mechanical parts, whereas a solid state drive uses non-volatile memory to store and access data. 
    Solid state drives are up to a hundred times faster than a hard disk drive.<br><br>
    2. Intel Core i3 CPU<br>
    Explanation: A CPU is an essential component in the computer, which performs calculations and gives instructions
    to the computer. The performance of the CPU has a big influence on the speed of the computer. There have been 
    big improvements in a CPU's speed in recent years, and the Intel i3 core CPU is a mid-level design. The 
    i5 or i7 processor is available for a reasonable price and is much faster than the i3 CPU. An i9 processor is 
    also available if the buyer is willing to spend more money.

<img src="/resources/microprocessor.jpg" width="300px">

<p class="answer">
    In the 1960s, the third generation of computers was made possible by integrated circuits. An integrated circuit is 
    a number of electronic circuits on a semiconductor or 'chip'. The most famous third-generation computer was 
    the 'Apollo Guidance Computer', designed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Without this computer, 
    the Apollo Program, which included landing a spacecraft on the moon would not have been possible.<br>
    The integrated circuit enabled computers to become smaller and more powerful. This lead to the development 
    of the supercomputer, the Cray-1; and continued to drive the modern era of super-computing. Super-computers 
    have helped to support scientific research and has contributed greatly to new scientific discoveries.
