<p><b>Question 2</b></p>
    
<p><b>(a)</b> Explain why data is stored in computers in binary format.</p>
    
<p class="answer">Data is stored on different components in computers such as the CPU, RAM and secondary 
    storage, as well as transistors and logic gates. These components contain circuits. Computers use and store information in binary format, which is 
    a system of representing information using only two digits: 0 and 1. These values are physically represented
    within a computer, when voltage flows through a circuit or not. In many computers a voltage of 3.3
    or 5 volts flowing through a circuit represents a 1. 0 volts flowing through the circuit represents 
    a 0. The use of binary information allows computers to rely on Boolean logic, which is an important part 
    of computer programming.
    In addition, all computers have a finite storage space and they aren't suitable for storing large quantities 
    of continuous data. So, it's necessary to store information in a discrete or binary form.
</p>
    
<p><b>(b)</b> A single bit can be used to represent two pieces of information.</p>
    
<p class="indent"><b>(i)</b> How many unique pieces of information could be represented using four bits?</p>
    
<div class="answer">

        </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>
    8+4+2+1=15
    <br><br>
    Answer = 15

</div>
    
<p class="indent"><b>(ii)</b> What is the minimum number of bits required to represent eight unique pieces of information?</p>
    
<p class="answer">3</p>
    
<p><b>Question 3</b></p>
    
<p><b>(a)</b> State two differences between RAM and ROM</p>
    
<p class="answer">
1. Random access memory is volatile. It stores data temporarily, while the computer is powered on. ROM, on the 
other hand is non-volatile, and stores information persistently. It stores information, regardless of whether
the computer is powered on or off.
2. RAM stores information for immediate use by the CPU, while ROM stores information that can be used at any time.
</p>
    
<p><b>(b)</b> Explain how increasing the amount of RAM on a computer might improve its performance.</p>
    
<p class="answer">Generally, the faster the RAM, the faster the processing 
    speed. With faster RAM, you increase the speed at which memory transfers
    information to other components. This improves the computer's overall performance.
</p>
    
<p><b>Question 4</b></p>
    
<p>You are asked to swap the values of two variables, x and y, which have already been initialised.</p>
    
<p><b>(a)</b> Why does the method shown not work?</p>
    
<pre class="code-block">
<code>
x=y
y=x
</code>
</pre>
    
<p class="answer">Since x and y have already been initalised, let's assume:<br>
x=5<br>
y=6<br><br>
Taking the code above:<br>
x=y, x is assigned the value 6.<br>
y=x, y is also assigned the value 6, since x=y.<br>
</p>
    
<p><b>(b)</b> Describe a method that does work. </p>
    
<p class="answer">To exchange the values:<br>
    z=x<br>
    x=y<br>
    y=z

<p><b>Question 6</b></p>
<p>You have been asked to assess an algorithm for a travel agent. The company gives discounts based 
    on the number of people in a group.<br>  
    The Python code below determines the type of discount to give based on the number of adults 
    (num_adults) and the number of children (num_children) in a travelling group.</p>

<pre  class="code-block">
<code>
num_adults = int(input("Enter the number of adults: "))
num_children = int(input("Enter the number of children: "))

if num_adults > 1 and num_children > 0:
print("Family discount")
elif num_adults >= 10:
print("Large group discount")
elif num_adults >= 5:
print("Small group discount")
else:
print("No discount")
</code>
</pre>
    
<p>Describe two scenarios where the algorithm could be perceived to be unfair.</p>

<p class="answer">
Scenario 1:<br>
There may be a scenario where there is a large group of adults and they don't have any children with them.<br> 
num_children !>0 <br>
In this case they won't get a discount.<br><br>
Scenario 2:<br>
The algorithm is mainly based on the number of adults. What if there is a large group of children, like a 
school trip. If there aren't more than 4 adults, they won't get a discount.
</p>

<p><b>Question 7</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> Differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS</p>

<p class="answer">Both HTTP and HTTPS are communication protocols, which are a set of rules for transmitting data
     across the internet. The client-server model uses several different protocols. HTTP and HTTPS are two layers 
     of protocols in the client-server model.<br>HTTP stands for hyper text transfer protocol, which is a 
     request-response protocol. It allows a client to issue a request for a resource (such as a web page) 
    and the server to respond.<br>HTTPS stands for hyper text transfer protocol secure. It is a secure version of
     HTTP. When using HTTPS, data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted. This prevents anyone who
    intercepts the data to understand the data. HTTPS has become the standard on the internet in recent years, 
    particularly for online payments.</p>

<p><b>(b)</b></p>
<p>Explain how the TCP communication protocol provides reliable communication between 
    computers.</p>
<p class="answer">Transmission control protocol operates at the transport layer, ensuring that binary information
    is transported reliably between computers. The infomration is broken up into packets for efficient routing.
    TCP keeps track of each of these packets, ensuring that they remain free of error and arrive at the client in
    the same order as those tansmission by the server.
</p>

<p><b>Question 8</b></p>
<p>The Unicode representation for the ‘thumbs up’ emoji character, is the hexadecimal 
    number 1F44D.</p>
<p><b>(a)</b> Explain why emoji characters are not represented using the American 
    Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).</p>

<p class="answer">ASCII is a character encoding system that only includes up to 256 characters, 
    primarily composed of English letters, numbers, and symbols. It uses up to eight bits to represent each 
    character. In contrast, Unicode is a much larger encoding standard that includes over 149,000 characters.
    It covers most of the world's writing systems, including ASCII, as well as symbols and emojis.
</p>
<p><b>(b)</b> Express the hexadecimal number 1F44D as a binary number. The first four bits have been 
    completed for you.</p>

<div class="answer">
   
    
<p>

Convert each hex digit to 4 binary digits:<br><br>
1f44d<br><br>
= 0001 1111 0100 0100 1101

</p>
    
</div>

<p><b>Question 9</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> What is an operating system?</p>
<p class="answer">An operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, 
    and provides common services for computer programs. Examples of operating systems include:
Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
</p>
<p><b>(b)</b> The diagram in Figure 3 depicts some of the main layers of an operating system. Select any 
    two layers and explain their function.</p><br>

<img class="img500" src="/resources/2021-H-AB-pg10.jpg">

<p class="answer">
    Memory management: Memory management deals with memory and the moving of processes from disk to primary 
    memory for 
    execution and back again. This is handled by the third layer of the operating system.<br>
    Processor scheduling: This layer deals with scheduling the processes for the CPU. There are many 
    scheduling queues that are used to handle processes. 
    When the processes enter the system, they are put into the job queue.
     The processes that are ready to execute in the main memory are kept in the ready queue.
</p>

<p><b>Question 10</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> State two tasks that would be undertaken by a project manager in a software design 
    process.
</p>
<p class="answer">A project manager is involved in producing a feasibility study and specification of
    requirements.<br>
    The project manager also forms and supervises the project team.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Some programming roles require the knowledge of low‐level programming. How does a low‐
    level computer program differ from a high‐level computer program?</p>
<p class="answer">Based on the closeness of a programming language to the system hardware (mainly processor), 
    computer programming languages are classified into two categories namely, high-level languages and low-level 
    languages. The most fundamental difference between the two is that low-level 
    languages are closer to the system hardware and require the knowledge of hardware to write the instructions.<br>
    A High-Level Language is a computer programming language that uses English like statements to write the 
    computer instructions.
     High-level languages are most widely programming languages because they are easy to understand to human being.
</p>

<p><b>Question 11</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> State two benefits of computer modelling.</p>
<p>Computer models are software used to represent a real or virtual problem and simulate what is happening in 
    the system the model represents.
    These simulations allow the computer user to gain knowledge and make predictions about the model that
    is frequently safer, cheaper and faster than conducting real-world experiments.
</p>
<p><b>(b)</b> Explain how agent‐based modelling may have been used during the COVID‐19 pandemic to 
    influence public health policy.</p>
<p class="answer">Agent-based models were used to help understand the spread of Covid. It helped experts 
    predict trends and advise state organisation to deal effectively with the pandemic. Agent based models
    simulated the transmission of Covid, the effect of lockdowns, vaccine roll-outs, and controlled 
    return to work and school. 
</p>

<p><b>Question 12</b></p>
<p>The following selection of data is taken from a table in a database used to store information about 
    dogs. </p>

</table>
<br>
<p><b>(a)</b> State why each of the following fields would not be good candidates for a primary key in the 
    table shown above.</p>
<p class="answer">A primary key needs to be unique.<br>
In the 'dog_name' column, 'fido' has been included twice, so this shows how a dog's name is not a good unique id
for a database.<br>
'breed' is also not a good choice for a primary key. Even though there is no repetition, it would very likely that
at some point, two dogs of the same breed will be added to the database.
</p>
<p><b>(b)</b> One owner can own many dogs. Explain how a foreign key could be introduced to improve 
    the design of this database.</p>

<img src="/resources/SVG/Asset 7.svg" width="1000px">

<p class="answer">
A primary key should be added to the dog table. Then each dog would have a unique id. This 
primary key would then be added as a foreign key in the owner table. By doing this, you can remove the 
information on dogs from the owner table, included in the columns: dog_name, breed, dob, microchip. This 
information is represented by the foreign key and can be accessed through an SQL query.

</div>

<p>Answer any one question</p>

<p><b>Question 13</b></p>
<p>Eircode is the postal address code system used in Ireland to uniquely identify every individual 
    address in the country. An Eircode is a seven‐character code made up of two parts – a three‐
    character Routing Key and a four‐character Unique Identifier.<br>
    The first character in the Routing Key must always be a letter, and the second and third characters 
    must always be digits.<br>
    Every character in the Unique Identifier must be alpha‐numeric i.e. either a letter or a number.  
    The format of the Eircode, A65 F4E2, is shown below in Figure 4.</p>
<img class="img1000" src="/resources/eircode.jpg">

<p><b>(a)</b> Explain why each of the following are not valid Eircodes.</p>
<p><b>(i)</b> GA5 AOK1</p>
<p class="answer">The second character is not a digit.</p>
<p><b>(ii)</b> X234 Y56</p>
<p class="answer">The routing key is four characters when it should be three. The Unique identifier is 
    three and it should be four.
</p>
<p><b>(iii)</b> 8XT A43Y</p>
<p class="answer">The first character of the routing key must be a letter. Here it is a digit.</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> The intention of the Python code shown below is to implement a validation check for an 
    Eircode.</p>

<pre class="code-block">
<code>
1 def is_valid_eircode(test_eircode):
2
3 # This function checks whether 'test_eircode' is a valid Eircode or not
4 # It returns True if 'test_eircode' is a valid Eircode. False otherwise.
5
6 # Uses:
7 # s.isalpha() -> True if s contains alphabetic only; False otherwise
8 # s.idigit() -> True if s contains digits only; False otherwise
9 # s.isalnum() -> True if s contains alpha-numeric only; False otherwise
10
11 if not test_eircode[0].isalpha():
12 return False
13
14 # if the second character isn’t a digit or the third character isn’t a
15 # digit the Eircode is invalid so return False
16 if ((not test_eircode[1].isdigit()) or (not test_eircode[2].isdigit())):
17 return False
18
19 if not test_eircode[-4:].isalnum():
20 return False
21
22 return True
</code>
</pre>

<p><b>(i)</b> What is meant by the term ‘validation check’?</p>
<p class="answer">
    Data validation means checking the accuracy and quality of
     data before processing it. For example, when signing up for a user account on a website, 
     the validation might include: a presence check to ensure a username is entered; and a length check to determine 
     if a password is at least eight characters long. 
</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> Outline briefly how a test case could be used to test the above code. </p>
<p class="answer">It's important to make sure the software doesn't do anything it shouldn't do. So as a test case,
    you could choose to test and Eircode that you know should fail the validation check and return a false result.
    If the program doesn't return a false output, then the program isn't functioning and needs to be analysed for 
    'bugs'.
</p>

<p><b>(iii)</b> Two types of testing that could be performed on the code are unit testing and system 
    testing. Distinguish between these two types of testing.</p>
<p>Unit testing is often carried out during the 'Create' stage. This is the stage when the software is actually 
    written. It's important that lessons can be learnt at every stage of the 'create' stage, which involves 
    unit testing and iteration.
</p>
<p>System testing tests the entire system. The aim of system testing is to ensure it meets the specification
    agreed with the client and the users.
</p>

<p><b>(iv)</b> This Python code will show that the Eircode, A99 SP@M A1OK, is valid even though it is 
    not. Why does the code indicate that this Eircode is valid?</p>
<p class="answer">is_valid_eircode() tests the first three characters and the last four characters of the Eircode
    being tested. So any characters between the third character and the last four characters could be anything and 
    still pass the test.
</p>
<p><b>(v)</b> After code has been changed it is important to conduct regression testing. Why is this 
    important?</p>
<p class="answer">Regression testing is a type of software testing conducted after a code update to ensure that 
    the update introduced no new bugs. 
    This is because new code may bring in new logic that conflicts with the existing code, leading to errors.</p>
<p><b>(c)</b> The following questions are based on the code in part (b).</p> 
<p><b>(i)</b> Explain what the following code does:</p>

<pre class="code-block">
<code>
11 if not test_eircode[0].isalpha():
12 return False 
</code>
</pre>

<p class="answer">This is a python 'if statement'. It tests whether the first character in test_eircode is a letter. 
    If it's not a letter, the output is "False".
</p>
<p><b>(ii)</b> Consider the following statement from line 16. </p>

<pre class="code-block">
<code>
16 if ((not test_eircode[1].isdigit()) or (not test_eircode[2].isdigit())):
</code>
</pre>

<p>If we let P represent the possible boolean values for 
    test_eircode[1].isdigit() and Q represent the possible boolean values for 
    test_eircode[2].isdigit(), complete the truth table below for the 
    expression, not P or not Q.</p>

<br>
<p><b>(iii)</b> Using the same meanings for P and Q from part (ii) complete the truth table below for 
    the expression, not (P and Q).</p>

<p><b>(iv)</b> Use your findings from parts (ii) and (iii) to re‐write the statement on line 16, without 
    changing its logical meaning.</p>

<pre class="code-block">
<code>
if ((not test_eircode[1].isdigit()) or (not test_eircode[2].isdigit())):

<pre class="code-block">
<code>
var P = test_eircode[1].isdigit()
var Q = test_eircode[2].isdigit()

if ((not P) or (not Q)):

<p><b>(v)</b> Explain how the technique of string slicing could be used to provide an alternative to 
    the statement on line 16.</p>
<pre class="code-block">
<code>
if ((not test_eircode[1].isdigit()) or (not test_eircode[2].isdigit())):
</code>
</pre>

<p class="answer">You can return a range of characters by using string slicing. To do this, you specify the start 
    index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string. Rather than two separate statements
to analyse the second and third characters, one statement can be used with string slicing.

<p><b>Question 14</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> Consider a two‐player game in which each player takes alternate turns 
    at removing matchsticks from a board. The rules of the game are
    simple:<br>
    - at each turn a player must remove either one or two matchsticks<br>
    - the player who takes the last matchstick wins<br>
    Winning and losing positions are defined in terms of the number of matchsticks left on the 
    board.
    A winning position (W) is a position from which a player cannot lose if she/he makes all the 
    optimal moves until the end of the game. For example, 2 is a winning position because if the 
    player whose turn it is, makes the optimal move (i.e. removes the two remaining 
    matchsticks) they will win that game.  
    A losing position (L) is a position from which a player cannot win (assuming that their 
    opponent makes all the optimal moves until the game is over). 
    The win/loss table below depicts winning and losing positions for the scenarios where there 
    are 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 matchsticks left on the board.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>No. of matchsticks remaining</td>

        <td>W</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><b>(i)</b> Explain why 3 is a losing position.</p>
<p class="answer">Each player can only remove 1 or 2 matchsticks. So when there are three left, if player A
    takes 1 match stick, there will be 2 left. Player B wins by taking the last two. If player A takes two 
    match sticks, there will be 1 left, so player B wins by taking the last one.
</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> Explain why 4 is a winning position.</p>
<p class="answer">Assuming its player A's turn: player A should take 1 match stick. That will leave three left, 
    leaving the other player in a losing position, as explained in answer (i) above.</p>

<p class="answer">
-5 matches: Assuming it's player A's turn, they can take two matches away and leave player B in a loosing
position (3 matches has been already determined).<br>
-6 matches: Assuming it's player B's turn, they are in a loosing position, because whether they take one 
or two matches, they will leave player A in a winning position (5 or 4 matches).

<p><b>(iv)</b> Assume you are about to start a new game with 21 matchsticks. If your opponent 
    offered you the choice of going first or second, which would you choose? Justify your 
    answer.
</p>

<p class="answer">I'd go second. From what I have learnt previously, a pattern has formed. A losing position
    occurs in multiples of 3. 21 is a multiple of 3. So by letting the other player go first, whether 
    they take one or two matches, it will leave me in a winning position.

<p><b>(b)</b> Consider a variation of the game described in part (a) with two key differences: the 
    matchsticks are initially arranged into two separate piles on the board and a player can 
    remove any number of matchsticks from a single pile on their go. We will call the two piles 
    pile X and pile Y.<br>
    For example, in a game where pile X contains 10 matchsticks and pile Y contains 9 
matchsticks, a player may decide to remove 9 matchsticks from pile Y on their go.<br>
The player who removes the last matchstick(s) wins the game.<br>
(i) Below is a partially completed diagram for an end game scenario in which it is player 
A’s turn and there is only one matchstick left in pile X and two matchsticks left in pile Y 
(denoted by 1, 2).<br>  
The purpose of the diagram is to depict the eventual outcome for every possible move 
from this point in the game. The left‐hand branch of the diagram has been completed 
covering all eventualities if player A removes 1 matchstick from pile X (denoted by 
AX1).<br><br>
Complete the diagram to illustrate all possible moves and show who wins in each case.

<p><b>Question 15</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> Charles Stark Draper is often credited with the invention of embedded systems.<br>
    Embedded systems are a combination of hardware and software designed to 
    perform a specific function. They are called ‘embedded’ because they are 
    often used as part of a larger system. Many embedded systems use sensors 
    to receive analogue or digital inputs. The input data which is often supplied 
    in real time is then processed resulting in some sort of output. While not 
    every embedded system will have a user interface, some are designed to 
    meet the principles of universal design.
</p>
<p><b>(i)</b> Explain the terms hardware and software. Provide two examples of each.</p>

<p class="answer">Computer hardware is any physical comppponents or parts that contribute to a computer system.<br>
    Example 1: Central processing unit<br>
    Example 2: Keyboard
</p>
<p class="answer">Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific 
    tasks.<br>
    Example 1: Microsoft Teams<br>
    Example 2: Google classroom
</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> Provide one example of a digital sensor and one example of an analogue sensor.</p>
<p class="answer">
    Digital sensor: A button<br>
    Analogue sensor: A temperature sensor
</p>
<p><b>(iii)</b> Explain, with the aid of a diagram, the difference between digital and analogue input.</p>
<p class="answer">Digital inputs are discrete, finite electrical signals, represented in computers by binary code,
    1s and 0s. Analogue inputs are continuous, rather than discrete. There are many different possible values, 
    rather than just binary values. Examples of analogue inputs include temperature or magnetism. There are 
    a range of possible values, changing over time. In graphical terms, an analogue signal would be 
    represented by a wave, as shown below.<br><br>

<b><u>Analogue signal:</u></b><br><br>
<img src="/resources/analogSignal.png"><br><br><br>
<b><u>Digital signal:</u></b><br><br>
<img src="/resources/digitalSignal.png">
</p>

<p><b>(v)</b> Describe two advantages of embedded systems over general purpose computer 
    systems, such as desktop computers and laptops.</p>

<p class="answer">
    1. Embedded systems are usually cheaper because they are designed for a specific purpose and don't required 
    extra functions.<br>
    2. They also use less electricity, so they're  more environmentally friendly.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> According to the description provided in part (a), mobile devices such as smartphones and 
    tablets could be considered to contain multiple embedded systems.</p>
<p><b>(i)</b> Describe two examples of embedded systems on mobile devices.</p>

<p class="answer">
    1. In a mobile phone, a camera is an embedded system. It has it's own hardware and software.<br><br>
    2. A speaker is also an embedded system. It is designed for a special purpose, rather than for various purposes.
</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> In the context of mobile devices distinguish clearly between the terms, ‘user interface’ 
    and ‘universal design’.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Both user interface and universal design, are aspects of user-centred design, which ensures
    the mobile phone can be used as effectively as possible.<br>
    The user interface is an important part of user experience, which highlights the importance of a good quality
    user experience when interacting with the mobile phone. It includes the graphical elements, such as the operating 
    system layout and links; as well as the physical elements, like ports and buttons.<br>
    Universal design is a process of designing the mobile device so it is easy to understand, access and use it,
    regardless of their age, size, or ability. Universal design is based on several principals, including: 
    equitable use, flexibility, simplicity, perceptible information, tolerance for error, low physical effort,
    and appropriate size and space. 
</p>

<p><b>(iii)</b> State two principles of universal design. For each principle you should describe how it 
    relates to the design of an embedded system of your choice.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Principle 1:<br>
    'Equitable use' means that the device is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.<br>
    The vacuum robot is a device that is designed for equitable use because it solves a problem that most people
    face, and so is useful to everyone. It can also be used by people of different abilities.<br><br>
    Principle 2:<br>
    'Simple and intuitive use' means that the design is easy to understand , regardless of the users'
    experience, knowledge or language skills.<br>
    The vacuum robot is also designed for simple and intuitive use. The user controls are in several languages and 
    easy to understand, with icons and diagrams to assist the user.
</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> The market for embedded systems is likely to continue to grow for the foreseeable future as 
    they are seen as key drivers of current and emerging trends in computing such as the 
    Internet of Things (IoT), smart homes, smart cities, drones and surveillance technology.  
    Discuss the potential impact of embedded systems on society. In your answer you should 
    provide evidence that you have considered alternative perspectives of any two stakeholders 
    that you think are relevant.</p>

<p class="answer">
    As you approach your front door, you activate the remote control in
    your key. The door unlocks and the lock sends messages to change
    the lights, the central heating, the television and your cooker. The hall
    lights, television, cooker and heating all turn on as you have previously
    programmed them to do. When you go in, you open the fridge and an
    announcement reminds you that you will be running out of eggs soon
    and tells you that it has put them on your shopping list. This is an example of domestic 
    'internet of things'. The internet of things is made possible by embedded systems being able to 
    connect together in a network.<br>
    One stakeholder that I would consider important in this trend towards this internet of things is 
    'the customer'. The emerging trends in computing is partly driven by commercial interests. 
    There are enormous profits to be made by selling all these electrical devices; and these devices are 
    made desirable through marketing techniques, transmitted through media like television and the internet.
    These devices are designed to gather information through sensors in embedded systems. The data gathered 
    can create 'smart' environments, like the smart home described above. For the customer, this brings value.
    It can improve their 'quality of life'. Having a smart home has advantages, such as saving time, money 
     and reducing stress levels. But there are also concerns surrounding privacy. Who should have access to this 
     data other than the customer and why? There is also the consumption of electricity to consider. If we all 
     have smart homes, we'll be contributing to a growing global problem of excessive energy consumption and global 
     warming.<br>
    Another stakeholder that is important in these emerging trends is 'the government'. Smart cities could be
     extremely useful in situations that need a rapid local response. For example, if an ambulance is taking 
     a seriously injured accident victim to hospital across a busy town or city, a camera could detect the 
     flashing light on the ambulance and then send messages to the traffic lights in order to ensure that the 
     ambulance has a clear route to its destination. A smart city could be equipped with thousands of remote 
     sensors that report information on water leaks, public lighting, traffic congestion, litter
     and, indeed, anything that can be ‘sensed’.<br>
     One of the most obvious areas to benefit from the IoT is the health service. Biosensors are capable of 
     detecting serious biological conditions. A person with heart problems might have an implant sensor
     that monitors the level of cholesterol in the blood stream. This sensor could send a warning to the person’s 
     home or the local doctor. Speed is
     often the essential feature of successful treatment in such cases and the
     IoT provides just that. So, embedded devices can help with managing the health services
     but there are many opportunities for the government to use data science to help manage and run the country's 
     public services. Security is another area where embedded systems such as drones and security cameras can come
     in useful. The gardai should use technology to maintain law and order. The use of embedded systems can help to 
     make gardai more effective and assist with surveillance and prosecution of crime. The use of video footage can 
     be used in court to help prove a crime has been committed and help protect Irish citizens from dangerous 
     criminals.
