    accessible.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> What is meant by the term ‘user interface’?</p>

<p class="answer">
    A user interface is the means by which the user and a computer system interact,
     in particular the use of input devices and software.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Name and describe one type of user interface that a computer system might use.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Name: An operating system<br>
    Description: An operating system is software that is used to manage computer hardware and 
    software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
</p>

<p><b>Question 5</b></p>

<p>Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) refers to a suite of
    protocols used to send and receive messages over the internet. The TCP/IP
    protocol suite contains a number of different layers. Name one of these layers
    and describe what happens within this layer.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Layer name: Internet layer<br>
    Layer description: The internet layer, also known as the network layer, controls the flow and routing of 
    traffic to ensure data is sent speedily and accurately. 
    This layer is also responsible for reassembling the data packet at its destination.

<p><b>Question 8</b></p>

<img src="/resources/riverPic.jpg" width="200px"><span>Figure 3</span>
<p>
A farmer needs to ferry a wolf, a goat and a cabbage from one side of a
river to the other in a boat, as shown in Figure 3. However, the boat only
has room for the farmer and one other item, either the wolf, the goat or
the cabbage. If left alone without the farmer present, the wolf would eat
the goat, and the goat would eat the cabbage.<br>
The state of the system at any given point in time can be represented using
an ordered list of four values as follows:<br><br>

(&lt;side for farmer>, &lt;side for wolf>, &lt;side for goat>, &lt;side for cabbage>)<br><br>

By using the letter E to represent the east side of the river, and the letter W to represent the west
side of the river, the state (E, E, E, E) means that all four are on the east side of the river.<br>
(E, E, E, E) is the initial state of the system. </p>

<p><b>(a)</b> Using this notation, what is the desired final state of the system? </p>

<p class="answer">
(W, W, W, W)
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> The state (W, E, E, W) is considered a loss state because the wolf will eat the goat (as
    the farmer and the cabbage are both on the west side).</p>

<p><b>(i)</b> Using this notation, name any other two loss states.</p>

<p class="answer">
    1. (W, W, E, E)<br>
    2. (E, E, W, W)
</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> Using this notation, name any one non-loss state, other than the initial and final states</p>

<p class="answer">
    (E, W, E, W)
</p>

<p><b>Question 9</b></p>
<p>Chop Cup is a magic routine which involves three cups face down and one ball underneath one of
    the cups. In any single move the position of two cups can be swapped using one of three possible
    moves, A, B or C as shown in Figure 4 below. </p>

<img src="/resources/cups-game.jpg" width="550px">
<span>Figure 4</span>

<p>Each cup is identified by its position. Initially the leftmost cup is at position 1, the middle cup is at
    position 2 and the right cup is at position 3. </p>

<p><b>(a)</b> Given that the ball starts under the leftmost cup (position 1) and always remains under the
    same cup, state the ball position after the sequence of moves, ABCBCA.</p>

<p class="answer">
   B 
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Without knowing which cup the ball is under, construct a sequence involving at least three
    moves which results in the ball ending in the same position as it started from. </p>

<p class="answer">
    ACB
</p>

<p><b>Question 10</b></p>
<p>Quicksort is widely recognised as one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works by
    recursively partitioning a list about one of the elements known as the pivot. Consider the unsorted
    list of integers shown in Figure 5 below and answer the questions that follow. </p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>80</td>
        <td>40</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>50</td>
        <td>20</td>
        <td>70</td>
        <td>90</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<span>Figure 5</span>

<p><b>(a)</b> Using the leftmost element as the pivot, show the contents of the list after the initial
    partition by the quicksort algorithm. You should assume that the elements in the left and
    right sub-lists are not re-ordered.</p>

<div class="answer">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>30</td>
            <td>60</td>
            <td>80</td>
            <td>40</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>50</td>
            <td>20</td>
            <td>70</td>
            <td>90</td>
