<p><b>Question 2</b></p>
<p>Registers and RAM are both types of volatile memory.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> What is volatile memory? </p>

<p class="answer">
    Volatile memory is a type of memory that maintains 
    its data only while the device is powered. If the power is interrupted for any reason, the data is lost.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Describe two differences between registers and RAM.</p>

<p class="answer">
    1. Register memory is faster than RAM. It is also more expensive and smaller.<br>
    2. Register memory is located in the CPU. RAM is part of the main memory. RAM comes in the form of a chip 
    that is individually mounted on the motherboard or in the form of several chips on a small board connected 
    to the motherboard. 
</p>

<p><b>Question 3</b></p>
<p>In 1965 Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel Corporation, predicted that the
    number of transistors on an integrated circuit will approximately double every
    two years. This prediction became known as Moore’s Law and has turned out to
    be very accurate to the present day. </p>

<p><b>(a)</b> Explain the terms transistor and integrated circuit.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Transistor: A transistor is a semiconductor device that is a tiny electronic switch. A transistor allows a 
    small electrical current to switch on or off.<br>
    Integrated circuit: An integrated circuit is a series of electronic circuits on a single semiconductor or 
    'chip'.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> State one reason why Moore’s Law might not remain accurate in the future.</p>

<p class="answer">
    The main reason that Moore's law may not continue to be accurate is size. It will not be possible to 
    continue to pack more and more transistors into such a small space.
</p>

<p><b>Question 4</b></p>
<p>
    An automatic garage door has three inputs:<br>
    - A, the master ON/OFF switch<br>
    - B, a sensor on the left hand side<br>
    - C, a sensor on the right hand side<br>
    Once the master switch has been set ON, either sensor can trigger
    the door. This scenario can be represented by the logical
    statement: A AND (B OR C).

<p>Figure 2 shows an example of the client-server model of computing. </p>

<img src="/resources/client-server.jpg" width="500px"><br>
<span>Figure 2</span>

<p>Explain the client-server model of computing. In your answer you should make reference to the
    terms included in Figure 2. </p>

<p class="answer">
    The 'web client' is the user's computer. When the user wants to find a website using a browser, such as Microsoft 
    Edge, they type a url or search phrase in the browser, which sends a 'browser request' to the server. The 
    'server response' is data the server sends back to the web client, which is the list of search results
    for the website being searched for.<br>
    The client-server model, is a framework for dividing tasks between servers and clients, through a 
    computer network or the Internet.
</p>

<p><b>Question 7</b></p>
<p>On 14 May 2021, the Health Service Executive (HSE) of Ireland suffered a major ransomware
    cyberattack which caused all of its IT systems nationwide to be shut down.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> Explain the term ransomware.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Ransomware is a malware designed to deny a user or organization access to files on their 
    computer. By encrypting these files and demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key, 
    cyberattackers place organizations in a position where paying the ransom is the easiest and cheapest 
    way to regain access to their files.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> State two measures individuals or companies can take to reduce the risk of a cyberattack.</p>

<p class="answer">
    1. Individuals or companies can use anti-virus software on their computers.<br> 
    2. They can also make sure that they use strong passwords: over a certain length, a mixture of uppercase and 
    lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.
</p>

<p><b>Question 8</b></p>
<p>
    Cloud computing has been described as the third wave of the digital revolution.
    Outline one advantage and one disadvantage of cloud computing under the headings of both cost
    and impact on the environment. 
</p>

<p class="answer">
    Cost (advantage): Cloud computing makes it cheaper for individuals and companies. By renting cloud services, 
    companies pay only for what they use such as computing resources and disk space.<br>
    Cost (disadvantage): Adopting cloud solutions on a small scale and for short-term projects can be expensive.<br>
    Environment (advantage): It's more environmentally friendly for there to be centralised storage and management 
    of data. Computing resources are provided on-demand, with little waste.<br>
    Environment (disadvantage): Cloud base services use massive amounts of energy in a concentrated area.
</p>

<p><b>Question 9</b></p>
<p>Provide two examples of how machine learning can be used to benefit society.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics. Machine Learning is a 
    program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome. It's used in several areas of society, 
    including healthcare, education and security. For example: <br>
    1. Machine learning can help support healthcare professionals by analysing patterns in symptoms and 
    diagnosing illnesses.<br>
    2. Machine learning is used by law enforcement also. It can help identify criminals through facial recognition 
    software.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Outline briefly the issue of ‘bias’ in relation to machine learning.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Prejudice can be reflected by data that has been corrupted by human bias. Tha algorithm used in the machine 
    learning can also be biased, because it is designed by a human. That bias can be extended by 
    the analysis of that data in machine learning and then automated.
</p>

<p><b>Question 10</b></p>
<p>
    You have eight coins and a two pan scales. Both the coins and the scales are
    gold plated and the diameter and circumference of all the coins are exactly
    the same. The coins are worth €2 each, a total of €16.<br>
    - seven of the coins are genuine and weigh the same amount.<br>
    - one of the coins is fake and is heavier than the others.
</p>
<p><b>(a)</b> Explain a way that the fake coin can be found in the minimum number of weighings. </p>

<p class="answer">
    Divide the pile of 8 coins in two and weight them, one pile on each pan. Keep the side that is heavier and get 
    rid of the other pile. Divide the pile in two and repeat the process.
    Keep doing this until you are left with the heaviest coin.<br>
    This is based on binary search: a search algorithm used in computer science. The way to calculate the maximum 
    number of times the coins have to be weighed until the heavist coin is found is by the equation:<br>
    log base 2 of 8 = 3.<br>
    So, the coins will have to be weighed 3 times to find the heaviest coin.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Outline briefly your use of abstraction to tackle this problem.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Abstraction is ignoring irrelevent details and reducing a problem to its essential features. 
    The question involves irrelevent details that I ignored; such as the the pan and coins are gold plated. I 
    reduced the problem to it's essential details and based on the core information, decided what the best strategy
    was.

</div>

<p>Answer any one question. </p>

<p><b>Question 13</b></p>

<p>
    K-9 Kennels is a small dog boarding business whose aim is
    to meet the needs of dog owners who often have difficulty
    in finding a safe and reliable place to leave their pets. Since
    it was established, owners John and Mary Chewit have
    worked tirelessly to grow the business, and in addition to
    boarding it now offers a range of other services including
    grooming, massage and training. 
</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> Mary and John realise that they need an information system and have appointed the
    software company you work for to design and develop the system. An initial meeting has
    been arranged and your manager has asked you to attend. </p>

<p><b>(i)</b> What is an information system?</p>

<p>
    An information system is a computer system used to collect, store, process and 
    transmit data and digital information. It includes hardware, 
    software, data and processes that allow people to communicate and work together.
</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> Provide two examples of how an information system could benefit K-9 Kennels. </p>

<p class="answer">
    1. K-9 Kennels needs a website to advertise it's services. It can provide information regarding 
    it's location, contact details, prices, payment system and any other relevent information the customer needs. A 
    website is essential part of a modern business strategy.<br>
    2. K-9 Kennels should also have a database to collect, store and use customer data to keep track of all 
    information necessary to provide a safe, good-quality service to it's customers and their pets: 
    including a customer's contact details and the pet's details, especially medical requirements and special dietary 
    needs.
</p>

<p><b>(iii)</b> Identify two key stakeholders and their respective roles in relation to the new system.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Stakeholder 1: Business analyst<br>
    Role: The business analyst is involved before the rest of the team is formed. They identify the users and 
    other stakeholders and establish user and business requirements. They also investigate and document the nature of 
    the problem and work with the project manager on the feasibility study.<br><br>
    Stakeholder 2: Tester<br>
    Role: The tester produces test plans and carries out the tests. They collect test data and ensure that the 
    results are documented and reported.
</p>

<p><b>(iv)</b> Outline briefly two topics relating to the project which you anticipate will be discussed
    at the initial meeting</p>

<p class="answer">
    1. The online payment system: Modern information systems usually include an option for online payment, so 
    customers can avail of new modern systems for payment, which are more convenient for both customers and businesses.
    2. The database for storing customer information: Databases have replaced paper filing systems and are far better 
    for storing, accessing and analysing important information, essential for business operations.
</p>

<p><b>(iv)</b> John and Mary are unsure about whether their system should be a website or a mobile
    application. State whether you think John and Mary should opt for a web application
    or a mobile application. Provide two reasons for this choice. </p>

<p class="answer">
    A website is more appropriate because a mobile app is usually software that has been adapted for a mobile phone.
    It needs to be downloaded and can't be accessed through the internet. K-9 kennels needs an information system 
    to make customers aware of services they provide.
</p>

<p><b>(iv)</b> Explain why the choice of software development process is important when it comes
    to designing and developing software systems. </p>

<p class="website">
    There are two main approaches to software development, iterative or staged. The choice between the two depends 
    a few different things, including the type of software, the team and the environment. Agile is a software 
    development process that is considered flexible and collaborative. The waterfall approach is more formal and 
    less flexible than the agile approach.
</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> Some weeks after the initial meeting John and Mary contact your company to request that
    an online store be included as part of the system. The store will be made up of two pages – a
    shop page and a checkout page.</p>

<p><b>(i)</b> The shop page should allow visitors to browse items. When a visitor wishes to
    purchase an item, they should be able to click an ‘Add to Cart’ button.
    Create a wireframe diagram to show the layout of the shop page. Your wireframe
    should include annotations outlining the purpose of the main elements. </p>

<img src="/resources/wireframe.png" width="550px">

<p><b>(ii)</b> Describe two user-centred design features you would use in the design of your system
    for John and Mary. </p>

<p class="answer">
    1. A clear, simple user interface, so customers can easily understand and interact with the website.
    2. A fast, hassle free user-experience. No registration necessary, you can register/sign in using gmail or outlook. 
    Only the essential details are collected when purchasing a service. 
</p>

<p><b>(iii)</b> State two differences between wireframes and prototypes.</p>

<p class="answer">
    A wireframe is used to map out the main features and navigation of the design. 
    It gives an idea of the site's functionality. A prototype is an early version of the design, built to test 
    the design and get feedback from the users. It includes the key aspects of the final system.
</p>

<p><b>(iv)</b> The checkout page will allow users to enter their delivery and payment details in order
    to finalise their order.
    Provide one example of each of the following types of data that the system should
    collect on the checkout page. </p>

<p class="answer">
    String: Name and address<br>
    Integer: Credit card number<br>
    Boolean: True/false (premium delivery)
</p>

<p><b>Question 14</b></p>

<p><b>(a)</b> A simplified version of the selection sort algorithm involves the use of two lists called list1
    and list2. At the start of the algorithm the elements in list1 are unsorted, and list2
    is empty as shown.</p>

<img src="/resources/sortAlg1.jpg" width="150px">

<p>At the end of the algorithm list1 is empty, and list2 contains the elements that were in
    list1 at the start, now sorted in ascending order</p>

<img src="/resources/sortAlg2.jpg" width="150px">

<p>The algorithm is described by the following pseudo-code: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Let N be the number of elements in list1</li>
    <li>Initialise an empty list of length N – call this list2</li>
    <li>Repeat N times:</li>

<p><b>(ii)</b> The algorithm sorts the list in ascending order. What changes would you need to make
    to the algorithm so that it sorts the list in descending order? </p>

<p class="answer">
    Steps 4 and 5 need to be changed to the following:<br>
    4. Select the largest (maximum) element from list1<br>
    5. Move the largest element from list1 to list2
</p>

<p><b>(iii)</b> Step 4 of the algorithm says to select the smallest (minimum) element from list1.
    Outline a method to find the smallest element in any list. </p>

<p class="answer">
    The min() function returns the item with the lowest value. So, to find the smallest item in the list above, 
    using Python:

    a = (15, 28, 14, 21)
    x = min(a)
</p>

<p><b>(iv)</b> Step 5 of the algorithm says to move the smallest element from list1 to list2.
    Why would the algorithm not work if this step said to copy the smallest element from
    list1 to list2?</p>

<p class="answer">
    If the element is copied from list1 to list2, then when the list is searched again for the smallest element, 
    it will find the same element, because it wasn't moved, it was copied.
</p>

<p><b>(v)</b> The algorithm relies on two lists to complete the sort. Describe a selection sort
    algorithm that would sort a list ‘in place’ i.e. without the need for a second list.</p>

<p class="answer">
    The selection sort algorithm sorts the items in place, without the need for a second list. 
    The algorithm maintains a marker such that at all times:<br>
    - all items to the right of the marker are unsorted<br>
    - all items to the left of the marker have been sorted.<br>
    The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest item to the right of the marker and then swapping this 
    item with the item at the marker. The marker is then advanced to the next position until the list is completely
    sorted.

<p><b>(i)</b> Fill in the empty boxes below to complete passes 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the insertion sort.</p>

<img src="/resources/insertionSort.svg" width="350px">

<p><b>(ii)</b> Explain how the insertion sort algorithm works.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Insertion sort: A list with one item is already sorted. A list with two items can be sorted by sorting the 
    second item relative to the first. If the second item is greater than the first, the two items are already 
    sorted and nothing further needs to be done; otherwise we obtain our sorted list by swapping the two items.
    A list with three items can be sorted by sorting the first two items (as just described) and then sorting 
    the third item relative to the first two. This continues until the list is fully sorted.
</p>

<p><b>(iii)</b> A list that is already reversed would be considered a good test case for the insertion

</p>

<p><b>(iv)</b> "Big O" notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm. Discuss the
    algorithmic complexity of the insertion sort algorithm using "Big O" notation. </p>

<p class="answer">
    Big O is a notation used in Computer Science to describe the worst case running time (or
space requirements) of an algorithm in terms of the size of its input usually denoted by 𝑛.<br>
Insertion sort is an example of an algorithm whose time complexity is quadratic. The amount of time it takes to 
complete your study in this case is known as quadratic time and is written as O(𝑛<sup>2</sup>). Algorithms in 
this class are impractical to use when it comes to dealing with large volumes of data.

<p><b>Question 15</b></p>

<p>
    A check digit is a single digit number used to verify numbers such as
    barcodes, credit cards and International Standard Book Numbers
    (ISBNs), thereby helping to prevent data entry errors.
    Check digits usually appear as the rightmost digit (position 1) of a
    number. For example, the check digit of the ISBN number,
    1020041102 highlighted here is 2. 
</p>

<p>
The general procedure used to verify ISBN numbers is as follows:<br>
Step 1: Multiply each digit in the number by its own digit position.<br>
Step 2: Add the 10 results together.<br>
Step 3: Divide the total by 11.<br>
Step 4: If the remainder is zero the ISBN number is deemed to be valid<br>
</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> Apply the above procedure to verify that the ISBN number 1020041102 is valid.</p>

<p class="answer">
    Step 1:<br>
    2*1 = 2<br>
    0*2 = 0<br>
    1*3 = 3<br>
    1*4 = 4<br>
    4*5 = 20<br>
    0*6 = 0<br>
    0*7 = 0<br>
    2*8 = 16<br>
    0*9 = 0<br>
    1*10 = 10<br><br>

    Step 2:<br>
    2+0+3+4+20+0+0+16+0+10 = 55<br><br>

    Step 3:<br>
    55/11 = 5<br><br>

    Step 4:<br>
    The remainder is 0, so the ISBN number is valid.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Given a 9-digit number, the Python program below can be used to find the number’s check
    digit, that will be used as the 10th digit.</p>

<pre class="code-block">
<code>
# A program to determine a check digit for a number
isbn = "102004110"
total = 0
for i in range(10, 1, -1):
total = total + int(isbn[10-i]) * i

check_digit = 11 - (total % 11)
print("The check digit for", isbn, "is", check_digit)
</code>
</pre>

<p><b>(i)</b> Line 1 of the above program contains a comment.
    State two reasons why programmers use comments. </p>

<p class="answer">
Reason 1: Comments are used to explain what the code does. Often programmers work in teams, and other programmers 
need to understand what your code does.<br>
Reason 2: Comments can also be used to help find sections in your code if the program is very long.<br>
</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> The program makes use of a number of variables and data types.
    Explain the terms variable and data type using one example of each from the code.</p>

<p class="answer">
Variables are containers for storing data values. Variables are created and vlues assigned to it.<br>
For example: total = 0<br><br>

A data type is a type of variable. Variables can store data of different types, and different types 
can do different things.<br>
For example: isbn = "102004110" is a string.
</p>

<p><b>(iii)</b> The program makes use of the Python int function.
    Outline the purpose of the int function as it is used in the code. </p>

<p class="answer">
    The int() function is used to change isbn, from type string to type int.
</p>

<p><b>(iv)</b> The range function on line 4 of the program generates a sequence of every integer
    from 10 down to 1 (but not including 1). Describe one way these integers are used in
    the program.</p>

<p class="answer">
    The algorithm for determining if the isbn is valid, includes multiplying each digit by it's own digit position.
    The range function cycles through the digit positions needed for that arithmetic calculation.
</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> The Python program below shows an alternative implementation.</p>

<pre class="code-block">
<code>
# A program to determine a check digit for a number
isbn = 102004110
isbn1 = isbn
total = 0
for i in range(2, 11):
digit = isbn % 10
total = total + digit*i
isbn = isbn//10

check_digit = 11 - (total % 11)
print("The check digit for", isbn1, "is", check_digit)
</code>
</pre>

<p><b>(i)</b> Complete the trace table below to show the changing states of the variables during
    program execution.</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> What is the purpose of the variable called isbn1 in the program?</p>

<p>
    The isbn1 variable is used to store the original isbn value; whereas the isbn value changes each time the 
    program loops through the range of numbers.
</p>

<p><b>(iii)</b> The program makes use of a number of arithmetic operators. State the purpose of
    each of the operators listed below.</p>

<p class="answer">
    % is the modulus operator. It divides a number and returns the remainder.<br><br>
    // is floor division. It divides the number and rounds the result down to the nearest whole number.
</p>

<p><b>(iv)</b> Identify two key differences between the algorithms used in parts (b) and (c)</p>

<p class="answer">
    Difference 1: In part b, isbn is originally a string and it's changed to an integer.<br>
    Difference 2: The range function in part c, loops through a range of numbers backwards, whereas part b loops 
    through a range of numbers forwards.<br>
</p>

<p><b>(v)</b> Provide an example of one type of data entry error a check digit could be used to
    prevent.</p>

<p class="answer">
    A data entry error could include an isbn number that isn't long enough.
