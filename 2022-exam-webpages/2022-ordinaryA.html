<span>Figure 1</span>

<p class="answer">
    1. A computer model can do repetitive tasks over long periods of time. Computers are far more suited to 
    these kinds of tasks than humans.<br>
    2. Computer models can collect, store and analyse large amounts of data using AI and machine learning. 
</p>

<p><b>Question 3</b></p>

<p>The pseudocode, shown in Figure 2 below, has been designed to run on a Microbit or similar
    embedded system, shown in Figure 3. The embedded system has a green LED (light emitting
    diode) connected to pin 0, a yellow LED connected to pin 1 and a red LED connected to pin 2.
    Answer the questions that follow.</p>

</div>
<span>Figure 2</span>

<p><b>(a)</b> Why are pauses included in this algorithm? </p>

<p class="answer">
    Pauses are included so the lights stay on for 2 seconds, otherwise they may not be noticed.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Describe the appearance of the LEDs at the end of the algorithm.  </p>

<p class="answer">
    The last two steps of the algorithm involve pins 1 and 2. The yellow light turns off and the red light turns on.
</p>

<p><b>Question 4</b></p>

<p>
    If you were to look inside any modern computer, such as that in Figure 4,
    you may be able to identify some of the following components:<br>
    -Motherboard<br>
    -Central Processing Unit (CPU)<br>
    -Fan<br>
    -Memory<br>
    -Hard drive<br>
    -Video card<br>
    Select any three of the components listed above and briefly describe their purpose. 
</p>

<img src="/resources/insideComputer.jpg" width="350px">

<p class="answer">
    Motherboard: The motherboard is generally a thin circuit board that holds together almost 
    all parts of a computer except input and output devices. All crucial hardware like CPU, memory, 
    hard drive, and ports for input and output devices are located on the motherboard.<br><br>
    CPU: The central processing unit carries out all the important functions of a computer. It receives 
    instructions from both the hardware and active software and produces output. It then performs calculations, 
    manipulates data, and produces output based on those instructions.<br><br>
    Video card: A video card connects to the motherboard of a computer system and generates output images
     to display. Video cards are also referred to as graphics cards.
</p>

<p><b>Question 5</b></p>

<p>
    A linear search algorithm, written in Python, is used to search the following list of integers.<br>
    list = [11, 52, 37, 94, 12, 73, 62, 47] 
</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> What index value will be returned if you search for the number 94? </p>

<p class="answer">
    3
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Describe a limitation of the linear search algorithm. </p>

<p class="answer">
    The main disadvantage of the linear search algorithm lies in its lack of efficiency. The more
elements there are in a list the greater the amount of time it will take to search for any
specific element. In fact, the amount of time it takes to find a target value increases in
proportion to the number of elements in the list to search. Therefore, it will take ten times
longer to find an element in a list of 1,000 elements than it would for a list of 100 elements. 
</p>

<p><b>Question 6</b></p>
<p>The flowchart, in Figure 5 below, is that of an algorithm for a game where the user has to guess a
    number between 1 and 10 that has been randomly selected by the computer.</p>

<img src="/resources/flowchart-ord1.jpg" width="550px"><br>
<span>Figure 5</span>

<p><b>(a)</b> What text is missing from the symbol labelled A? </p>

<p class="answer">
    if (guess < number)
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> This game will end after the user makes one guess. Suggest an improvement to the
    algorithm.</p>

<p class="answer">
    If the user's first guess is incorrect, they get another guess. The program asks them to input another number. 
    The program tells the user if the first guess 
    is too high or too low, so they have a good chance of getting the second answer correct.
</p>

<p><b>Question 7</b></p>
<p>Name one female that has made a significant impact
    on the field of computer science and briefly describe
    the development she worked on. </p>

<img src="/resources/femaleScientists.jpg" width="550px">

<p class="answer">
    Margaret Hamilton was the team leader for the software engineers that developed the Apollo Guidance Computer. 
    This software was essential to 
    landing the first people on the moon. The Apollo Guidance Computer was designed at the Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology (MIT) and was an example of the third generation 
    of computers, which were based on integrated circuits. The third generation of computers were smaller, 
    more powerful and led to the era of super-computers. 
</p>

<p><b>Question 8</b></p>

<p>
    COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the use of technology and the Internet for remote work
in business and education. It has also highlighted issues in the area known as the “digital divide”. 
</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> Describe one way digital technology has helped us during the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>

<p class="answer">
    During the Covid pandemic, remote working allowed employees from companies to keep working together in groups, 
    while still maintaining social distancing. Microsoft Teams for example, uses digital technology to provide a 
    way for computer users to connect by video link, using the internet.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> The digital divide refers to the gap between people from different backgrounds that have access 
    to modern information and communications technology (ICT), and those that don't have access.</p>

<p><b>Question 9</b></p>

<span>Figure 10</span>

<p><b>(i)</b> Describe one other development from the last 100 years that has been very important
    for computing and technology.</p>

<p class="answer">
    The first personal computers or PCs arrived on the market in the 1970s and early 1980s. These included
    models from brands like IBM and Apple.
</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> Select a development from either Figure 10 or the development you described in
    part (i) and provide two reasons why you think this development was important.</p>

<p class="answer">
    The development of the integrated circuit led to the third generation of computers in the 1960s. An 
    integrated circuit is a number of electronic circuits all on a semiconductor or 'chip'. The third 
    generation of computers allowed the development of smaller computers. Computers were small 
    enough to be transported from one location to another. The integrated circuit also increased the computing 
    power of computers and led to the first 'super-computer', the Cray-1.
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> The World Wide Web and the Internet are often thought to be the same thing but they are
    different. Explain the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet. </p>

<p class="answer">
    The Internet is a collection of interconnected networks spanning the globe. It's billions of connected computers and other,
     including the 'internet of things'.<br>
    The world wide web is a system of connected websites, hosted on the internet. It includes HTML pages, videos,
    pictures and audio files.
</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> It is very important to have a website that has a good user interface and is easy for the user
    to use. Examine the screenshot of the website www.irishwrecksonline.net, shown in Figure
    11 on the next page, and answer the questions that follow.</p>

<img src="/resources/wrecksOnline.svg" width="750px">

<p><b>(i)</b> Identify one good feature and one poor feature of user interface design on the
    website. </p>

<p class="answer">
    Good feature: There is a menu with links to navigate the site<br>
    Poor feature: There is alot of unnecessary information on the homepage
</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> Suggest three improvements to the design of this website.</p>

<p class="answer">
    1. The website could have a more traditional layout with the menu on the top or the side of the webpage.<br>
    2. The menu links should be buttons or hyperlinks, not both.<br>
    3. Delete unnecessary information from the homepage, such as the 'creative commons' license. Put that
    information in a more appropriate place, not in the header.
</p>

<p><b>(d)</b> Accessibility features are vitally important when designing websites and apps so that they
    can be used by all users. Describe three ways by which designers of websites and apps can
    make them accessible to users with different needs.</p>

<p class="answer">
    1. There could be an option to translate the site into different languages.<br>
    2. The html code could include alt tags for visually impaired users who have screen readers.<br>
    3. The webpage has many different fonts and font-sizes. The font-size should be easily legible and
     more consistent.
